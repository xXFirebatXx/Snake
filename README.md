# Snake

## Description

Snake is a game where the player controls a snake on a grid. The snake moves around the grid, and the player can control the snake using the arrow keys. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The snake can also grow longer by eating food. The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the grid or the snake itself.
